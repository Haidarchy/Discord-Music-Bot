"# Discord-Music-Bot" 

===============================================================================
Discord Music Bot Project with https://github.com/dtsvetkovuni on JavaScript.
===============================================================================

===============================================================================
!!! The bot currently works only on one discord server (GUILD). !!!
===============================================================================


                        !!!IMPORTANT!!!
To emplement your bot into the code you need to get: 
"CLIENT_ID", "TOKEN" from https://discord.com/developers/applications 
"GUILD_ID" from the Discord server you want the bot to be.

Once you get all that information change "CLIENT_ID" and "GUILD_ID" in "index.js" and "TOKEN" in ".env"



To START the bot you must open a terminal in VC (Visual Code) and type:

1. node index.js load (this will load up the commands /play, /np, etc...)
2. node index.js (this will start the bot and you should be able to see it "online" in your server)

The BOT is currently working with YouTube, Soundcload and Spotify.
